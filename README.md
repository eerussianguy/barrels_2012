Barrels 2012 makes things from TerraFirmaCraft wearable on the player's back, similar to how it was in the Classic mod (ie, in 2012). The following things are wearable:

* Barrels
* Large Vessels
* Lamps (with dynamic light functionality)
* Anvils
* Powderkegs (just don't accidentally step on a fire!)
