# Barrels 2012

Barrels 2012 makes things from TerraFirmaCraft wearable on the player's back, similar to how it was in the Classic mod (ie, in 2012). The following things are wearable:

* Barrels
* Large Vessels
* Lamps (with dynamic light functionality)
* Anvils
* Powderkegs (just don't accidentally step on a fire!)
* Crucibles

Notes on using the mod:
* The Curios menu is accessible by pressing 'G' or by clicking the button next to the player in the inventory.
* Adding an item to the item tag `curios:back` will allow it to be placed on the back. Any rendering that is done is custom by me, Curios won't do that automatically.
* This mod automatically registers renderers for other TFC addons' blocks. For example, any `BarrelBlock` instance will receive a renderer on its item.

This mod requires the [Curios API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/curios).
